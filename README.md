# Dotfiles

### Requirements
Set zsh as your default shell (on Ubuntu):
    
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install zsh
    sudo apt install neovim
    chsh -s $(which zsh)

### Steps
- Clone this repository into a folder that's something along the lines of ~/dotfiles
- change to the newly created folder
- enter ./install to run the dotbot

In one step, you could just do: 
`git clone $url && cd dotfiles && ./install`
